# Dev Practice Portfolio

This repository is a focused showcase of my technical front-end skills, separate from my project-based work. It captures a structured collection of exercises and mini-projects designed to highlight my coding methodology, reasoning, and problem-solving approach in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Each subfolder contains:
- Clear examples of code for core front-end topics
- Explanations of my approach and problem-solving reasoning
- Clean, working code with versioned commits reflecting my thought process

Future subfolders may include additional exercises in React and Python to complement this initial collection. Subfolders may also be updated periodically to reflect new skills or refinements to existing exercises.

This repository demonstrates my commitment to mastering the fundamentals of front-end development and my ability to translate knowledge into structured, readable, and functional code.
