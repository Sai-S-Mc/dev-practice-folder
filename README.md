# Dev Practice Folder

This is my technical skill-building space, separate from my project-based repositories.

Right now, I'm focusing on vanilla front-end development - strengthening my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals through daily, targeted practice.

Each subfolder contains:
- Daily breakdowns of what I practiced
- My reasoning, approach, and problem-solving notes
- Clean, working code with commit history

Future additions may include:
- React front-end practice

This repo is designed to show my commitment to growing as a front-end developer, not just through polished projects, but through the day-to-day effort of mastering the fundamentals.
