# Core JavaScript Skill Showcase

This folder demonstrates my mastery of core JavaScript fundamentals through curated exercises that highlight clean code, reasoning, and problem-solving skills. Each file includes working code, clear explanations of my approach, and test cases illustrating inputs and expected outputs.

## Concepts Highlighted

- Variables (`let`, `const`) and scope  
- Data types, coercion, and `typeof`  
- Conditionals (`if`)  
- Loops (`for`, `for...of`)  
- Functions and scope  
- Arrays and objects  
- Strings and string manipulation  

## Exercises Included

- Count occurrences of items in an array  
- Filter numbers from an array that are greater than the given threshold
- Find the average of the numbers in an array
- Find the largest number in an array  
- FizzBuzz  
- Filter even numbers from an array  
- Check if a string is a palindrome  
- Reverse a string  
- Sum all numbers in an array  
- Capitalize the first letter of each word in a string  

## Notes

- Exercises include both manual logic and built-in method alternatives where applicable.  
- Each solution emphasizes readability, clarity of reasoning, and practical application of JavaScript concepts.  
- This folder is a curated skill showcase, demonstrating applied knowledge rather than exhaustive practice.
